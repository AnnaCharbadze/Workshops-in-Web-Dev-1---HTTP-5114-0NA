<h2>Course Description</h2>

This course allows students to access additional support for content delivered in the other classes each semester. Every student in the class will engage in a process of self-assesment to help them identify areas where they would benefit from help, and then the student and teaching team will set up a process for providing support for any areas where the student would benefit from some in-the-moment support.
